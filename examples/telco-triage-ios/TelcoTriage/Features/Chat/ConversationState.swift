/// ADR-023 Phase 2 — session-scoped conversation state that lives

///
///  - `pendingClarification` — the assistant's last reply asked a
///    clarification question (Telco `.clarification` lane OR a
///    tool-action turn with missing required slots). The next user
///    message should be interpreted as the answer to that question
///    BEFORE running the full classifier.
///
///  - `pendingToolConfirmation` — the assistant's last reply proposed
///    a tool awaiting Confirm. A bare "yes" / "ok" from the user can
///    be routed straight to `confirmTool`. Cleared on confirm /
///    decline / any other message.
///
///  - `liveAgentRequestCount` — how many times the user has explicitly
///    asked for a human in this session. The `EscalateOnFrustrationNBA`
///    fires when this hits 2, even if the trained `emotional_state`
///    head is silent (calm-but-repeating power user).
///
///  - `didntWorkCount` — how many times the user has reported the
///    previous suggestion didn't work. Same NBA boost as above —
///    "fix it, didn't work, fix it again, didn't work" is the
///    canonical escalation signal regardless of affect.
