# Fine-Tuning Recipe

This folder documents the training recipe used to produce the private demo
checkpoint:

```text
felipeliquid/LFM2.5-1.6B-VL-Extract-Plume-Demo
```

The runtime demo is intentionally "give them the fish"; this folder is the
"teach them to fish" part. It shows the schema, dataset shape, manifest, and
LEAP fine-tuning config used for the demo checkpoint.

## What Was Trained

The task is schema-conditioned visual extraction:

```text
rendered methane observation image + fixed schema -> one flat JSON object
```

Base model:

```text
LiquidAI/LFM2.5-VL-1.6B
```

Final training mix:

| Component | Rows |
|---|---:|
| Methane/context rows | 17,234 |
| Structured-output replay rows | 3,416 |
| Total | 20,650 |

The methane rows used the fixed schema in [`schema.yaml`](schema.yaml). Replay
rows came from other strict-JSON VLM extraction tasks and were mixed in to
reduce regression on general structured-output behavior.

## Public Data Sources

The checkpoint was built from public methane remote-sensing sources rendered
into demo-friendly observation images.

| Source | How it was used | License / note |
|---|---|---|
| [STARCOP](https://zenodo.org/records/7863343) | Main absent/uncertain set and some present examples using AVIRIS-NG / simulated multispectral products | Zenodo lists CC-BY-NC-4.0. Do not redistribute derived imagery without checking usage. |
| [MethaneSET](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tacofoundation/methaneset) | Present examples from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/9, and EMIT-derived products | Hugging Face lists cc-by-nc-sa-4.0. Do not redistribute derived imagery without checking usage. |
| [JPL AVIRIS-NG CH4/CO2 benchmark](https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/benchmark_methane_carbon_dioxide.html) | Used in source/eval exploration and the held-out proxy eval; not counted as a final v6 training source in the training manifest | JPL page describes ten AVIRIS-NG scenes with methane and carbon dioxide point-source emissions. |

The cookbook does **not** redistribute source imagery, rendered train images, or
the 20,650-row training JSONL. Users should regenerate their own dataset from
source data they are allowed to use, or use their own customer imagery.

## Exact Dataset Manifest

[`training_manifest_context_v6.json`](training_manifest_context_v6.json)
records the exact final training mix, checksums, hyperparameters, and eval
scores. The key values are:

```text
train.jsonl SHA-256: b95c62e532769f8070fd1dcaa94e5207e8392389194f8f7add63ec36fc84e904
methane labels SHA-256: 97a439af58bf985a23fa6505fcae2237affd44af02030232d2a71b446b4eb3fa
schema SHA-256: dd7ddbdf57b272e71e29c6a86af98156bf2f158f5a244880300fe0de43066cfe
```

Final methane row counts:

| Field | Counts |
|---|---|
| `methane_plume_status` | absent 5,750; present 9,734; uncertain 1,750 |
| `source_dataset` | STARCOP 10,904; MethaneSET 6,146; unknown/context-extra 184 |
| `source_context` | not_applicable 5,750; unknown 3,430; well_pad 3,070; landfill 945; mine 839; agriculture 800; processing_facility 800; pipeline_corridor 800; compressor_station 800 |

The `unknown/context-extra` bucket is preserved from the original manifest. Most
of those rows were MethaneSET EMIT-derived context examples whose
`source_dataset` field was not normalized in the local manifest.

## Training Row Format

LEAP VLM SFT consumed a JSONL file where each row contains a `sample_id` and
`messages`. See [`sample_train_row.json`](sample_train_row.json).

The important shape is:

```json
{
  "sample_id": "methane:...",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Extract the following from the image:\n\n<schema.yaml contents>"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "image": "/outputs/.../image.png"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "{\"methane_plume_status\":\"absent\",...}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The assistant text is a compact JSON string, not a nested object.

## Preparing A Training Bundle

If you already have labels in this local eval-style format:

```json
{
  "image": "/absolute/path/to/rendered_observation.png",
  "schema": {"methane_plume_status": "..."},
  "ground_truth": {"methane_plume_status": "present"},
  "metadata": {"sample_id": "source:id", "source_dataset": "starcop"}
}
```

you can convert them into the LEAP VLM SFT message format with:

```bash
python training/scripts/prepare_modal_training_bundle_with_replay.py \
  --schema training/schema.yaml \
  --labels-jsonl /path/to/methane_train_context_v6_17234.jsonl \
  --bundle-root /path/to/local_bundle_root \
  --dataset-name methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650 \
  --remote-root /outputs/methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650 \
  --min-samples 10000 \
  --replay real_iad:/path/to/real_iad_train.jsonl:1500 \
  --replay visa:/path/to/visa_train.jsonl:1500 \
  --replay forge:/path/to/forge_train.jsonl:416
```

This writes:

```text
/path/to/local_bundle_root/methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650/train.local.jsonl
/path/to/local_bundle_root/methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650/train.jsonl
/path/to/local_bundle_root/methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650/manifest.json
/path/to/local_bundle_root/methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650/images/
```

`train.local.jsonl` points at local image paths. `train.jsonl` points at the
Modal volume paths used by the LEAP config.

## Fine-Tuning With LEAP

The exact config used for the demo checkpoint is
[`leap_finetune_modal.yaml`](leap_finetune_modal.yaml).

After staging `train.jsonl` and its `images/` directory into the Modal volume so
that this path exists:

```text
/outputs/methane_plume_context_v6_train17234_replay20650/train.jsonl
```

run LEAP fine-tune from a checkout with VLM SFT support:

```bash
leap-finetune examples/methane-plume-extraction/training/leap_finetune_modal.yaml
```

The demo run used:

```text
1x NVIDIA H100 on Modal
1 epoch
2,529 steps
LoRA r=16, alpha=32
learning rate 2e-5
runtime 1h 28m 47s after data upload
final train loss 0.04211
final eval loss 0.01687
```

## Eval Summary

The held-out evals are proxy demo labels, not customer-adjudicated production
gold.

| Split | Samples | JSON valid | Strict value exact | LLM judge | VLM judge |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Core | 235 | 100.0% | 94.4% | 0.959 | 0.889 |
| Stress | 265 | 100.0% | 77.5% | 0.821 | 0.826 |

Known limitation: the `uncertain` class remained weak on stress examples and
was often over-called as `present`.

## Reproducibility Notes

- This folder documents the checkpoint recipe; it does not make the private
  model or the source datasets public.
- The final training labels were best-effort demo labels. For a customer or
  production system, replace them with customer-approved human labels.
- The rendered context panel is demo metadata. It should not be described as
  independent GIS/source attribution.
- Before sharing rendered images or derived labels, review the source licenses
  and attribution requirements.
