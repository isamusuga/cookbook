/// Why a value type rather than a `String?` parameter:
///
///   - Sendable, `Equatable` — safe to capture in tests, to compare in
///     assertions, to thread through actor boundaries without copies.
///   - Extensible — future signals (e.g. weighted prior-user text,
///     turn-distance decay, intent-conditioned re-weighting) land here
///     without re-shaping every call site.
///   - The retrieval surface ALWAYS takes a `RetrievalContext`. Empty
///     means "single-turn behaviour" rather than "I forgot to wire it"
///     — the type system makes the contract obvious.
///
/// **Scope discipline.** Only signals that ColBERT can ACTUALLY consume
/// belong here. Lane, intent, slot-store snapshots do NOT — those route
/// through `ConversationSnapshot` to the router, not to the retriever.
